When you create a branch, you make a copy of your current working project. In this copy you can make changes and try things without damaging the working code. It is also useful when multiple people work on a project, so for example each feature of an app has a different branch, and the teams can make their commits without interfering with each other.
When one branch is finished, has been tested etc, it will be merged to the master branch.
